# black_scholes_derivation

TODO: also want "title card" style animation at the beginning
TODO: create frozen requirements.txt for final package versions

The sequence of scenes here is:

* [introduction.py](introduction.py): Introduce authors, Nobel Prize, and options market growth. Then, allude to the
  traditional derivation being complicated and some basic steps we'll take to dodge those complications.
* [what_is_an_option.py](what_is_an_option.py): Describe what a stock is, how stock value is determined over time, and
  what an option is. The option introduction includes an explicit example and the (call) payoff diagram.
* [finding_a_fair_price.py](finding_a_fair_price.py): Mention the difficulty of pricing an asset that depends on
  (unknown) future stock prices, and how a simulation could address this.
